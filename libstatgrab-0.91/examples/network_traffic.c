/* A very basic example of how to get the network statistics from the system
 * and diaply them. Also it adds up all the traffic to create and print out
 * a total
 * Takes several arguments :
 * -d <number> 	Takes the number of seconds to wait to get traffic sent since last call
 * 		Note, this is not network traffic per second. Its the traffic since last
 * 		call. If you want it traffic per second averaged over time since last call
 * 		You need to divide against the time since last time this was called. The time
 * 		between 2 calls is stored in systime in the network_stat_t structure.
 * -b		Display in bytes
 * -k		Display in kilobytes
 * -m		Display in megabytes
